OAS preliminary report

* Contents
- Redistricting contentious issue. Claim about its impact, eg. economist or NYT. 
- Truth is that strategic manipulation of electoral boundaries has been present since the foundation of the USA. Gerrymandering refers to 1810 governnor.
- Redistricting every decade to approximate ideal of one-person-one-vote after census reveals demographic imbalances between the 50 states.
- The process in the US is politicized: Congress apportions, then state legislatures have the authority to enact a district map through legislation. That is, elected officials participate directly in the process. 
- Another model, used in a handful of states, is to delegate the redistricting process to an independent commission. 
- Implications of legislation: governor also intervenes, can veto the proposal. Courts too.
- 10 states with independent redistricting: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Washington. Years adopted?
- Get %v and %s for house 2012:2018 at state level. Plot w 45o line.
